# üöÄ Kaizen Flow System - Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ System Status: FIXED AND READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

The Kaizen Flow blockchain event system has been completely fixed and is now ready for deployment. All transaction processing issues have been resolved.

## üîß What Was Fixed

### 1. Contract Address Mismatch

- **Before**: Contracts referenced `0xb08860843312e513` (incorrect)
- **After**: Contracts now use `0xb03ac3adafdd51f2` (correct deployed address)

### 2. Transaction Structure

- **Before**: Incorrect account entitlements and capability access
- **After**: Proper Flow transaction structure with correct account permissions

### 3. Transaction Verification

- **Before**: No transaction status checking
- **After**: Complete transaction verification system with blockchain confirmation

### 4. Error Handling

- **Before**: Poor error messages and no debugging info
- **After**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging

## üöÄ Quick Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp env.template .env.local

# Update .env.local with your contract addresses
NEXT_PUBLIC_KAIZEN_EVENT_CONTRACT=0xb03ac3adafdd51f2
NEXT_PUBLIC_KAIZEN_NFT_CONTRACT=0xb03ac3adafdd51f2
```

### Step 2: Deploy Smart Contracts

```bash
# Windows
deploy-contracts.bat

# Linux/Mac
./deploy-contracts.sh
```

### Step 3: Start the Application

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## üß™ Testing the Fixed System

### 1. Run System Test

```bash
node test-system.js
```

Expected output: ‚úÖ All tests passed!

### 2. Test Contract Deployment

```bash
flow scripts execute contracts/scripts/test_contracts.cdc --network=testnet
```

Expected output: "Contracts are working! Found X events"

### 3. Test Event Creation

1. Connect your Flow wallet
2. Create a new event
3. Verify transaction on Flowscan
4. Check event appears in the system

### 4. Test Event Joining

1. Connect a different wallet
2. Join the created event
3. Verify payment transaction
4. Check POAP NFT minting

## üîç Key Features Now Working

### ‚úÖ Transaction Processing

- Event creation transactions
- Event joining with FLOW payments
- POAP NFT minting
- Transaction verification and confirmation

### ‚úÖ Wallet Integration

- Flow wallet connection (Blocto, Lilico, Dapper)
- Account balance checking
- Transaction signing and submission

### ‚úÖ Smart Contract Interaction

- Proper contract imports and references
- Correct capability access patterns
- Event emission and handling

### ‚úÖ User Experience

- Real-time transaction status
- Blockchain verification display
- Error handling and user feedback
- Mobile-optimized interface

## üì± How to Use the Fixed System

### For Event Organizers

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use any Flow wallet (Blocto, Lilico, Dapper)
2. **Create Event**: Fill form and submit to blockchain
3. **Monitor**: Track attendees and payments in real-time
4. **Manage**: Update event details and manage registrations

### For Event Attendees

1. **Browse Events**: Discover events by category and location
2. **Connect Wallet**: Link your Flow wallet to the platform
3. **Join Event**: Pay with FLOW tokens and receive confirmation
4. **Collect POAP**: Automatically receive attendance NFT

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Frontend Layer

- **Next.js 15**: Modern React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui**: High-quality UI components

### Blockchain Layer

- **Flow Blockchain**: Fast, secure, and developer-friendly
- **Cadence**: Resource-oriented smart contract language
- **FCL**: Flow Client Library for wallet integration
- **Smart Contracts**: KaizenEvent and KaizenEventNFT

### Transaction Flow

1. User initiates action (create/join event)
2. Frontend constructs Cadence transaction
3. FCL submits transaction to Flow network
4. Transaction processed and confirmed
5. Frontend updates with blockchain data
6. User receives confirmation and rewards

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "Cannot find declaration" Error

**Problem**: Contract not found at specified address
**Solution**:

- Verify contracts are deployed: `flow accounts get 0xb03ac3adafdd51f2 --network=testnet`
- Check contract addresses in `.env.local`
- Redeploy contracts if necessary

#### 2. Transaction Preprocessing Failed

**Problem**: Transaction structure or permissions incorrect
**Solution**:

- Check contract deployment status
- Verify account has required capabilities
- Check Flow network status

#### 3. Wallet Connection Issues

**Problem**: Cannot connect Flow wallet
**Solution**:

- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try different Flow wallet
- Check network configuration
- Verify FCL configuration

#### 4. Insufficient Balance

**Problem**: User doesn't have enough FLOW tokens
**Solution**:

- Get testnet FLOW from faucet: <https://testnet-faucet.onflow.org/>
- Check wallet balance before transactions
- Verify payment amounts

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check contract deployment
flow accounts get 0xb03ac3adafdd51f2 --network=testnet

# View contract code
flow accounts get-contract KaizenEvent --network=testnet

# Check transaction status
flow transactions get <tx-hash> --network=testnet

# Test contract functionality
flow scripts execute contracts/scripts/test_contracts.cdc --network=testnet
```
